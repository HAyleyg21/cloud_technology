#a) Request two numbers, n1 and n2 from the console.
#b) n1 and n2 can be any integer value.
#c) Use a while loop to horizontally print n1 to n2 with increment by 1 if n1 is smaller than n2.
#d) Use a for loop to horizontally print n1 to n2 with decrement by 1 if n1 is greater than n2.
#e) Print a message, “n1 = n2” if n1 is equal to n2
